Tide is a mod that aims to enhance and expand the vanilla fishing system by adding many new mechanics as well as 60+ new fish to find in your worlds!

Note: Cloth Config is required for mod versions 1.2.0 and up!
This mod is also avaliable onÂ modrinth.

Specific fish can be found in specific areas. Some fish live in freshwater rivers and lakes while some prefer the oceans. In addition to this, fish can be found underground, with more unique fish for different levels. These fish can be eaten, cooked, crafted into useful items, or sold to fishermen villagers. To catch fish faster, different types of bait can be crafted, allowing you to hold them in your offhand while fishing to gain unique bonuses.

You can craft special fishing rods using the resources you find in your world by using a smithing table, a piece of string, and either a cobblestone block, iron ingot, gold ingot, diamond, or netherite ingot. These rods have much more durability and can be made early on, so remember to craft these. Fishing rods can now be customized to add special perks and looks to any rod. This can be done by crafting an Angler's Workshop, which will allow you to add special hooks, lines, and bobbers to fishing rods. Each upgrade has a different effect that can be added.

To reel in a fish, you will have to right click to time the marker with the center of the bar. If you get close enough, and the fish doesn't escape, you will catch it. If you miss, the fish will be lost. The stronger the fish, the harder it is to catch it. Be careful!

A multitude of other mechanics have been introduced, one of these being lava fishing. By using the Angler's Workshop to add a Lavaproof Fishing Hook to your rod, fishing rods can be used in all kinds of lava pools to reel in various fish and other items.


A new item that you get from the start of the game can help keep track of the fish you have collected: the Fishing Journal. Any new fish that you catch will be added to this book where you can view their category and some information about them. The book contains many pages that help sort the fish you find into unique categories and track your progress through the mod. This book can be re-crafted with a normal book and any fish if you lose it. If you're up for a challenge, try getting every entry in the fishing journal. This isn't a task for the faint of heart, however, and is a huge long-term goal, requiring you to visit different biomes and dimensions and become a master of fishing.

If you're lucky, you might reel in some large crates. They can be fished up pretty much anywhere, and can be hooked more commonly with magnetic bait. They can contain fish, random resources, and sometimes treasure. Just make sure you don't lose them if they happen to sink back into the ocean.
