**[1.3.2 - 9/26/24]**

‚öôÔ∏è Technical features ‚öôÔ∏è
- The mod now uses a datapack system for adding to the contents of the fishing journal! This is to
replace the older version of this system that used config files. Info on how to make one of these
datapacks will be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/Lightning-64/Tide/wiki) (once I create the page)
- Also, a [GitHub page](https://github.com/Lightning-64/Tide) containing the source code and the new
issue tracker is now avaliable too.

üé£ Other mod changes üé£
- Fixed a bug where treasure loot could not be caught while fishing! (sorry about that)
- Added a config setting for disabling the toast notifications that show when a new fish is found.
- Added a config setting for using the default fishing line color (for better visuals with shaders)
- Enchanted books can now be found in loot crates (0-1 per crate depending on the rarity)
- Some very minor bug fixes that aren't worth listing here lol
