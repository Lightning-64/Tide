**[1.3.0 - 9/15/24]**

üêü Fish entities are FINALLY a thing!
All the freshwater and saltwater fish items have entity counterparts.
They can be killed to get their fish item and spawn in their respective climates.
You can also right-click them with the fishing journal to view their profile easily.

‚öôÔ∏è New config settings, such as:
- Hold to cast
- Minigame difficulty
- Rod durability

üöÄ Compatibility with a bunch of other mods, including:
- Nether Depths Upgrade
- Stardew Fishing
- Rainbow Reef
- Fishing Real

üé£ And some other stuff
- Fishing journal now highlights newly unlocked fish (There's a config setting for this too)
